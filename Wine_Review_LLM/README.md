
THE MOST INTRESTING PROJECT HERE IS THE FINAL_WINE_REVIEW.py
i downloaded ALL huggingface datasets on wine, cleaned them from unnecessary data and fixed problem with score and how data got displayed/column of csv file
for example more then 70% of the data was using 1/5 start system while the other part 1/10 scoring system, i fixed dividing in half the score and transforming every data into float
