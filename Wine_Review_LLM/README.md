
THE MOST INTRESTING PROJECT HERE IS THE FINAL_WINE_REVIEW.py
i downloaded ALL huggingface datasets on wine, cleaned them from unnecessary data and fixed problem with score and how data got displayed/column of csv file

for example more then 70% of the data was using 1-5 star rating system while the other 30% w 1-10 scoring system, i fixed dividing in half the score and transforming every data into float
