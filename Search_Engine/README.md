this is just a bunch of script for example, i didnt tried to recreate google but get enought data for the competitor search engine and so this is whats inside in details:

multi_training_SAMPLE = training data scraper before the optimized final one, they still work but are not optimized
SEARCH_ENGINE_LIB AND USE_SEARCH_ENGINE_LIB are similar and are needed for find url based on a keyword

the simple search engine data scraper and trainer are auto-explicatory
