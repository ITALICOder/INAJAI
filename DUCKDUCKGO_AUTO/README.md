## Part of the project for gain more domain as possible

---

testermlptr.py use duckduckgo ip to domain reverse Search Engine for generate random ip then complete the captcha and get website result in a txt for future training

testerptr.py is the same thing without using selenium and the ml model for captcha so it will probably fail using multiple ip from tor network

tor_manager.py is the utility for get 10 socks5 proxylist for have multiple ip and try not to raise security measure

## MachineLearning captcha with ease

in the main script named trainer.py theres nothing complex, we label the image for recognize which is a duck and which is not and we train and valuate on some different labeled photos
